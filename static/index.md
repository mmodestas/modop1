# ESP8266-Based P1 Electricity Meter Reader

## Overview

This device is a compact and reliable solution for reading electricity meter data via the P1 port using an ESP8266 microcontroller. Built around the widely popular **D1 Mini** development board - one of the most commonly used platforms among home automation enthusiasts - it is **powered by ESPHome**, making configuration simple and integration with platforms like **Home Assistant** seamless. 

Leveraging the **DSMR library**, this reader is specifically adapted to comply with the Lithuanian P1 specification as defined by **ESO**, ensuring accurate and compatible data interpretation out of the box.

## Key Features

- **Optimized for Lithuanian Meters**  
  Fully aligned with ESO’s Lithuanian P1 protocol, ensuring seamless integration and reliable data capture.

- **Powered by ESPHome**  
  Easy to configure via YAML, with native support for Home Assistant and other automation platforms.

- **Improved Connectivity**  
  Designed to support an external antenna, addressing the poor signal performance commonly experienced with the D1 Mini’s onboard antenna—especially when installed in metal outdoor enclosures.

- **Stable Wireless Performance**  
  External antenna significantly enhances Wi-Fi signal strength, enabling more consistent and reliable data transmission.
